Introduction - What's new
=========================

## Phasing
The major difference in this fight is that in mythic, each major mechanic (spirits, seeds, suck) adds on to the previous ones. Additionally, the phasing now happens at **80%** and **60%**, rather than at 70% and 40% as in heroic. 

**TL;DR**, in mythic the phases look like this:

- Phase 1 (100% - 80%): Spirits
- Phase 2 (80% - 60%): Spirits *and* seeds
- Phase 3 (60% - 0%): Spirits *and* seeds *and* big suck

Sometimes the mechanics will overlap in ways that are very icky. It is important to position well and know how to deal with the mechanics -- especially difficult overlaps.

## Fleeting Spirits
In mythic, if a player is hit by a spirit, they are now mind-controlled *until they are killed*. Therefore, it is especially important to kite spirits properly.

**Important Mechanical Note: Spirits spawn behind the player**. This means it is important to be facing the direction in which the spirits will be kited. The boss *should* be positioned in such a way that everyone can be facing the correct direction when spirits come out without sacrificing damage.

**TL;DR: Do not face your back toward the portal.**

## Portal Placement
Portals will be positioned on opposite sides of the room *for the entire fight*. This is because spirits need to be kited and seeds need to be moved for the entire fight. During the big suck, instead of relying on a portal in the center of the room, raid movement CDs such as Wind Rush Totem and Stampeding Roar will be used.
